## About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at Brandeis International Business School. I have a solid academic background, having earned my Bachelor’s degree with Honors in International Business Management from the University of Bristol. My interest in data analytics and consulting has been shaped by hands-on experiences across various roles, including co-founding Innovasphere, where I helped businesses optimize operations through data-driven strategies, and my analyst internship at Celian, where I honed my skills in financial analysis and market research. I am passionate about leveraging data to solve complex business challenges and provide actionable insights, whether it’s through data visualization, predictive modeling, or consulting. I look forward to advancing my career as a consultant or data analyst, where I can continue to apply my technical and analytical expertise to create meaningful business impact.
